#    Description

  This homework had 4 tasks, and each required me to perform some simple operations on numbers, such as identifying odd numbers, powers of 2,
  check if a date given as a struct is valid(and sort the valid dates), create a BASE64 encoder and verify if a solved sudoku has wrong line/
  columns or squares.
