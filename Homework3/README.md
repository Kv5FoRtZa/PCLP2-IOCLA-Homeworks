#    Description

  This homework also has 4 tasks, but the tasks are a little bit more complicated.

  The first one required me to sort an adjacent list, by making new links between nodes and not by changing the orders of them.

  The second task needed a algorithm that separated words from a text and then sorted said words in a lexicographically order.

  The third task was about creating a kfibonacci array, while using only recursive functions.

  The last task gave me a couple strings, and i had to find the longes palindrom substring that is also the best in lexicographically order
