# PCLP2-IOCLA-Homeworks

Here are my 3 homeworks for the PCLP2 course. The first one is a basic translator between C and x86 Assembly, while the other two are full
Assembly homework.

The makefiles and some skeleton code were provided to me for the assembly ones(there are some your code starts/end here comments), 
while only the makefile was provided for the C one.
